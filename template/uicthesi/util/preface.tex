This is an optional section. PhD students can use this part to include some legal disclaimers. For instance, you can include a copyright statement about the originality of the work done by you, the statement disclosing the funding agency that supported your work (e.g. NSF/NIH grant numbers), IRB protocol numbers for human/animal studies, previously published works and also a reference to copyright permissions that allows you to reuse those published works in your thesis.
